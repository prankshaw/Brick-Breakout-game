<h2><strong>Rules</strong></h2>
<p>Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by <strong>P.R. Organisation</strong></p>
<article>In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.</article>
